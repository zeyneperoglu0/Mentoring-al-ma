1. Default Constructor

    Write a Java program to create a class called "Cat" with instance variables name and age. Implement a default constructor that initializes the name to "Unknown" and the age to 0. Print the values of the variables.

2. Parameterized Constructor

    Write a Java program to create a class called Dog with instance variables name and color. Implement a parameterized constructor that takes name and color as parameters and initializes the instance variables. Print the values of the variables.

3. Constructor Overloading

    Write a Java program to create a class called "Book" with instance variables title, author, and price. Implement a default constructor and two parameterized constructors:

    One constructor takes title and author as parameters.
    The other constructor takes title, author, and price as parameters.
    Print the values of the variables for each constructor.

4. Chaining Constructors

    Write a Java program to create a class called Student with instance variables studentId, studentName,
     and grade. Implement a default constructor and a parameterized constructor that takes all three instance variables.
     Use constructor chaining to initialize the variables. Print the values of the variables.

5. Copy Constructor

    Write a Java program to create a class called Rectangle with instance variables length and width. Implement a parameterized constructor and a copy constructor that initializes a new object using the values of an existing object. Print the values of the variables.

6. Constructor with Validation

    Write a Java program to create a class called Account with instance variables accountNumber and balance. Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these variables with validation:

    accountNumber should be non-null and non-empty.
    balance should be non-negative.
    Print an error message if the validation fails.

7. Constructor with Default Values

    Write a Java program to create a class called Car with instance variables make, model, and year. Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these variables and assigns default values if not provided. Print the values of the variables.

8. Overloading Constructors with Different Data Types

    Write a Java program to create a class called Point with instance variables x and y. Implement overloaded constructors:

    One constructor takes int parameters.
    Another constructor takes double parameters.
    Print the values of the variables for each constructor.

9. Constructor with Array Initialization

    Write a Java program to create a class called Classroom with instance variables className and students (an array of strings). Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these variables. Print the values of the variables.

10. Constructor for Singleton Pattern

    Write a Java program to create a class called Singleton that ensures only one instance of the class can be created. Implement a private constructor and a public static method to get the single instance of the class. Print a message indicating the creation of the instance.
